            This club was started to try and bring a closer eye to the cannabis industry in Michigan.   
            I was distressed by the difficulty of looking up information around the different recalls.
            I wanted the process to be as easy as possible with as little information as the consumer might have (like just the label on the product because you don't keep reciepts...).
